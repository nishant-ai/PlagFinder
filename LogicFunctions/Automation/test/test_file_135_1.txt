eaning lion, and πάρδος (pardos), meaning spotted.[10][11][12] The word λέοπάρδος originally referred to a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus).[13]

'Panther' is another common name, derived from Latin: panther and Ancient Greek: πάνθηρ (pánthēr);[10] The generic name Panthera originates in Latin: panthera, which refers to a hunting net for catching wild beasts that were used by the Romans in combats.[14] The phonetically similar Sanskrit: पाण्डर (pând-ara) means pale yellow, whitish or white.[15] The specific name Latin: pardus refers to a male panther.[16] The word pardus is thought to originate from Ancient Greek: παρδάλωτός (pardalotόs) meaning spotted like a leopard.[17]

The leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back.[18] Its skin colour varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its belly is whitish and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round.[19] Leopards living in arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the legs.[20] Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in rain forest habitats.[7] The pattern of the rosettes is unique in each individual.[21][22] This pattern is thought to be an adaptation to dense vegetation with patchy shadows, where it serves as camouflage.[23]

Its white-tipped tail is about 60–100 cm (23.6–39.4 in) long, white underneath and with spots that form incomplete bands toward the tail's end.[24] The guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about 25–30 mm (1.0–1.2 in). Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots.[21][25] Its fur tends to grow longer in colder climates.[26] The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are darker and with smaller spots inside.[19]

The leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38.[27] The chromosomes include four acrocentric, five metacentric, seven submetacentric and two telocentric pairs.[28]

Size and weight
The leopard is sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females.[24] It is muscular, with relatively short limbs and a broad head. Males stand 60–70 cm (23.6–27.6 in) at the shoulder, while females are 57–64 cm (22.4–25.2 in) tall. The head-and-body length ranges between 90 and 196 cm (2 ft 11.4 in and 6 ft 5.2 in) with a 66 to 102 cm (2 ft 2.0 in to 3 ft 4.2 in) long tail. Sizes vary geographically.[26] Males weigh 37–90 kg (81.6–198.4 lb), and females 28–60 kg (61.7–132.3 lb).[25][29] Some leopards in North Africa allegedly were as large as Barbary lions (Panthera leo leo). In 1913, an Algerian newspaper reported a leopard killed that allegedly measured about 275 cm (9 ft 0 in) in total length.[30] The maximum weight of a wild leopard in Southern Africa was about 96 kg (212 lb). It measured 262 cm (8 ft 7.1 in).[31] An Indian leopard killed in Himachal Pradesh in 2016 measured 261 cm (8 ft 6.8 in) with an estimated weight of 78.5 kg (173.1 lb); it was perhaps the largest known wild leopard in India.[32][33]

The largest skull of a leopard was recorded in India in 1920 and measured 28 cm (11.0 in) in basal length, 20 cm (7.9 in) in breadth, and weighed 1,000 g (2 lb 4 oz). The skull of an African leopard measured 285.8 mm (11.25 in) in basal length, and 181.0 mm (7.125 in) in breadth, and weighed 790 g (1 lb 12 oz).[34]

Variant colouration

A melanistic leopard or black panther
Main article: Black panther § Leopard
Melanistic leopards are also called black panthers. Melanism in leopards is caused by a recessive allele and inherited as a recessive trait.[35] Interbreeding in melanistic leopards produces a significantly smaller litter size than is produced by normal pairings.[36] The black leopard is common foremost in tropical and subtropical moist forests like the equatorial rainforest of the Malay Peninsula and the tropical rainforest on the slopes of some African mountains such as Mount Kenya.[37] Between January 1996 and March 2009, leopards were photographed at 16 sites in the Malay Peninsula in a sampling effort of more than 1,000 camera trap nights. Of the 445 photographs of melanistic leopards, 410 were taken in study sites south of the Kra Isthmus, where the non-melanistic morph was never photographed. These data indicate the near-fixation of the dark allele in the region. The expected time for the fixation of this recessive allele due to genetic drift alone ranged from about 1,100 years to about 100,000 years.[38][39] Pseudomelanistic leopards have also been reported.[40]

In India, nine pale and white leopards were reported between 1905 and 1967.[41] Leopards exhibiting erythrism were recorded between 1990 and 2015 in South Africa's Madikwe Game Reserve and in Mpumalanga. The cause of this morph, known as a "strawberry leopard" or "pink panther", is not well understood.[42]

Taxonomy

Map showing approximate distribution of leopard subspecies
Felis pardus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[43] The generic name Panthera was first used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.[44] Oken's classification was not widely accepted, and Felis or Leopardus was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.[45]

The leopard was designated as the type species of Panthera by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.[46] In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (P. tigris), lion (P. leo), and jaguar (P. onca) to Panthera.[47][48]

Subspecies
Following Linnaeus' first description, 27 leopard subspecies were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956. Since 1996, only eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of mitochondrial analysis.[49] Later analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the Arabian leopard.[50]

In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies as valid taxa:[4]

P. p. tulliana (Valenciennes, 1856)[56]	It is natns that are predictive of customer attrition in the past. When new customer data are available, the trained model can be used to predict customers who will unsubscribe in the future.When developing a new machine learning model, it is just as important to recognize its limitations as it is to understand its potential benefits. In the customer attrition example, the model is not predicting new, novel ways to retain customers. The model is learning based on historical patterns and then applying those patterns to predict future behavior.Machine learning systems are, however, self-learning. As new data labels become available (e.g., new modes of customer churn or attrition), models can be retrained to learn those new patterns.Figure 5 Examples of input signals and output data are required to train a supervised learning model.One of the simplest machine learning formulations is described in the following equation:In the above equation:Model features are represented by a feature matrix, X, where columns represent features, and rows correspond to each data point. With m features, and n data points, the dimensions of X are n X m. Labels are represented by a vector Y, where rows correspond to each data point (dimension n X 1). And model weights (or the importance) of each feature are represented by the vector, θ (dimension m X 1).The training task of the supervised machine learning algorithm involves finding feature weights, θ, that minimize a training loss function.The dimensionality of the problem is important to consider. The size of the feature space (m, in the above formulation) should typically be smaller than the number of labeled data points (n, in the above formulation).In practice, supervised machine learning problems are often limited by the number of labeled examples that are available from which the algorithm can learn. Usually, the more examples available, the higher the likelihood that a supervised technique will be successful.There are two main categories of supervised learning techniques: classification and regression.Classification models predict a class label, such as whether a customer will return or not, whether a certain transaction represents fraud or not, or whether a certain image is a car or not. Classification approaches are useful for business problems that have large amounts of historical data, including labels, that specify if something is in one group or another.Classification algorithms map inputs (X) to outputs (Y) where Y∈{1, … , C} with C being the number of classes. If C = 2, this is called binary classification, and if C > 2, this is called multiclass classification.An example of a classification task is predicting when an equipment or a machine is likely to fail. This predictive maintenance task is a common problem faced by manufacturing and operations-focused companies. Predictive maintenance can help avoid failure events that may be expensive or potentially dangerous.If sufficient historical failure examples are available, as well as other relevant input data (e.g., sensor data, technician notes), a supervised machine learning classifier can be trained to predict if equipment will be operating in the failed or not-failed class in the future. In supervised classification problems, training examples are often referred to as labels. The following figure shows an example of failure labels and classifier predictions.Figure 6 Time-series representation of a classifier label (“failed” or “not failed”) that can be used to train a predictive maintenance machine learning model using classification.Examples of supervised classifier models include support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT), random forest, and neural networks.Regression models predict quantities, such as how many customers are likely to churn or the sales forecast over the next week. Regression techniques are useful for business problems that have large historical datasets that correlate to numeric labels, including such things as sales, inventory, or loan value.Reconsider the predictive maintenance example we explored with a classifier model, but this time we want to predict equipment failure using a regression model. Instead of predicting a categorical label like “failed” or “not failed” (as with the classifier model), a regression model can be trained to predict a continuous value, such as time to failure, as shown in the Figure 7.Training a regression algorithm is similar to training a classifier. The feature matrix is comprised of input signals such as sensor data and work orders. The regression model also requires labels, but instead of a binary (1 or 0) indicator of class (“failed” or “not failed”), the label is numeric (time to failure).Figure 7 Time-series representation of a time-to-failure label that can be used to train a predictive maintenance machine learning model using regression.Examples of supervised regression models include linear regressions that predict a linear relationship between input features and outputs, ridge regressions that are a more advanced variation of linear regression, random forests that predict nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs using decision trees, and neural networks that predict nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs using layers of complex nodes.The following figure shows an example of a classification and regression technique. The left-hand side of the figure illustrates the result of a classification algorithm that estimates a decision boundary to separate two classes (the classes are represented with different symbols in the figure). The axes on the chart represent two input features. The right-hand side of the figure illustrates the result of a regression algorithm that predicts a quantity (shown on the y axis) as a function of a feature input (shown on the x axis).
