Good luck!Developer Relation at InstaMobileJust a typical Introvert Dev, America-no addict, passionate for AI and Blockchain.READ NEXT10 mins read | Author Derrick Mwiti | Updated May 25th, 2021In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents are trained on a reward and punishment mechanism. The agent is rewarded for correct moves and punished for the wrong ones. In doing so, the agent tries to minimize wrong moves and maximize the right ones. In this article, we’ll look at some of the real-world applications of reinforcement learning.Various papers have proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving. In self-driving cars, there are various aspects to consider, such as speed limits at various places, drivable zones, avoiding collisions — just to mention a few. Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways. For example, parking can be achieved by learning automatic parking policies. Lane changing can be achieved using Q-Learning while overtaking can be implemented by learning an overtaking policy while avoiding collision and maintaining a steady speed thereafter.AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous racing car that has been designed to test out RL in a physical track. It uses cameras to visualize the runway and a reinforcement learning model to control the throttle and direction.
