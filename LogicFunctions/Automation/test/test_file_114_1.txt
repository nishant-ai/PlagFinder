Since the onset of life, human vision is essential, beautiful, and complex. Until a decade ago, machines were not able to comprehend the visual world, as efficiently as we did.Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain comprehend the visual world in the form of images and videos. From an engineering perspective, it seeks to replicate and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.Computer vision uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to train computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see”.Computer scientists have been trying to give vision to computer vision for half a century, which led to the field of computer vision. The goal is to give computers the ability to extract a high-level understanding of the visual world from digital images and videos. If you’ve used a digital camera or smartphone, you know that computers are already good at capturing images and videos in incredible fidelity and detail, better than humans.Today, a lot of things have changed for the good of computer vision:1. Mobile tech with HD cameras has made quite a huge collection of images and videos available to the world.2.Computing power has increased and has become easily accessible and more affordable.3. Specific hardware and tools designed for computer vision are more widely available. We have discussed some tools later in this article.These advancements have been beneficial for computer vision. Accuracy rates for object identification and classification have gone from 50% to 99% in a decade, resulting in today’s computers being more accurate and quick than humans at detecting visual inputs.Computer vision is heavily used in healthcare. Medical diagnostics relies heavily on the study of images, scans, and photographs. The analysis of ultrasound images, MRI, and CT scans are part of the standard repertoire of modern medicine, and computer vision technologies promise not only to simplify this process but also to prevent false diagnoses and reduce treatment costs. Computer vision isn’t intended to replace medical professionals but to facilitate their work and support them in making decisions. Image segmentation helps in diagnostics by identifying relevant areas on 2D or 3D scans and colorizing them to facilitate the study of black and white images.Image Segmentation of Lung CT-ScansThis technology is used in the COVID-19 pandemic. Image segmentation can help physicians and scientists identify COVID-19 and analyze and quantify the infection and course of the disease. The trained image recognition algorithm identifies suspicious areas on CT scans of the lungs. It determines their size and volume so that the disease of affected patients can be clearly tracked. In monitoring a new disease, computer vision not only makes it easier for physicians to diagnose the condition and monitor it during therapy, but the technology also generates vMadara originated from Masashi Kishimoto's desire to elaborate on the ending to the manga series Naruto. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as "Part II" in the manga and Shippuden in the anime, Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki (and later on Madara) as their enemies.[2] In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains "flamboyant" was one of the "guiding principles" he followed. It was his desire to create villains with "powerful auras".[3] Madara appears late in the manga, as one of the masterminds leading to the fourth shinobi world war, in the final arc.[4] Nevertheless, he wanted to make him an engaging antagonist who would clash with Sasuke Uchiha and the Tailed Beast known as the Ten Tails to give the storyline a proper conclusion.[5]

According to Kishimoto, Madara is not just like any other character introduced in the series. He created Madara as a character with no weaknesses.[4] As one of the antagonists in the story, Kishimoto designed Madara as the antithesis to the protagonists' values, a perfect anti-hero.[6] Kishimoto also said Naruto always defeated his enemies without intending to kill them by settling disputes with words since his battle with Nagato. Naruto truly forgave his enemy instead of having kill them, a concept Kishimoto liked but which no other shonen manga truly followed.[2] Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more interesting and challenging, rather than killing them. So from the Nagato battle onwards, he decided to introduce the resurrected Madara to have someone to beat. According to Kishimoto, this was one of the reasons why he introduced Edo-Madara into the storyline. But he confessed this was complicated at first. It ended up with confusion about the difference between the two characters.[2]

Japanese voice actor Naoya Uchida enjoyed voicing Madara's character, most notably in his final recording where he sent regards to fellow actor Kazuhiko Inoue (Kakashi Hatake) and Wataru Takagi (Obito Uchiha).[7] Neil Kaplan first voiced Madara in the video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. Because CyberConnect2's fighting game's storyline preceded the television series' plot, he was asked by their staff to read the series' manga to get an idea of the character. Kaplan said this made it difficult for him to voice Madara for the first time.[8]

Appearances
In Naruto
Madara is mentioned in the second part of the manga Naruto but does not appear in most of the series except the war arc. During his childhood,[9] he met a child named Hashirama, but amidst the conflicts of their respective clans resulting in war, their friendship ends. After failing at several attempts to kill or defeat his rival, Madara became friends with him and accepted his treaty offering peace between the two clans. The Uchiha, Senju and all of their affiliated clans came together to form a village, which Madara named Konohagakure.[10] Madara took a merciless approach and did not like Hashirama's compassionate methods.[11] After the death of his brother, Izuna, Madara became cynical and vengeful and held a grudge against the Senju Clan for slaughtering his brothers in the War.[12] After his defection from Konoha, he believed there is no real peace. Losing all of his family and conflicted over his own clanmates, he decided to free the world from its pains,[13] by casting Infinite Tsukuyomi (無限月読­, Mugen Tsukuyomi) upon the whole world so that there would be no war and no death.[14] Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama's hand, but he survives and goes into hiding. He awakens the legendary Eye Technique Rinnegan[15] using Hashirama's DNA. Before dying, Madara takes Obito as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later.[16] After Madara's death, his greatest lasting influence was on Obito, one of his descendants, who used Madara's knowledge to strongly influence and control the Akatsuki behind the scenes, and pretended to be Madara for much of the manga's story. When Obito moves into the final stages of Madara's goal by initiating the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kabuto Yakushi forms an alliance with him, eventually reviving Madara's reanimated corpse.[17][18]

By nightfall, Madara releases himself from Kabuto's contract and rebounds his soul to the modified immortal body enabling him to act on his own will. Madara decides to reclaim the Nine-Tails creature sealed within Naruto and defeats the Kages, only to reunite with Obito while he is engaged in combat with the shinobis.[19] Madara fully resurrects himself by sacrificing the defeated Obito, ordering Black Zetsu to take control over Obito's body and perform the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique.[20] Restored to life, Madara unlocks his full potential and manages to break free of his restraints. Defeating his enemies, Madara goes after the Tailed beasts to revive Ten-Tails. Madara is then confronted by Might Guy, Minato Namikaze, Gaara and Rock Lee who each use all of their forces to kill him but fail. Before killing most of his enemies, Madara is confronted by the healed Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha who overwhelm him. Madara is forced to escape and regain Obito's Rinnegan. Upon returning to the field, Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The entire world becomes trapped in the dream. Sasuke manages to save Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura from this Illusionary Technique, and Black Zetsu stabs Madara, gaining control over his body. Black Zetsu reveals that it was never Madara's will but Kaguya's[21] Madara swells in size, Kaguya taking his place. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi manage to seal Kaguya, who reverts into ten tails before being sealed spitting out Madara. Eventually, Madara dies because of the toll of both the tailed beasts and Demonic Statue removed from his body.[22] In his final moments, Madara finds real peace within the dreams of Hashirama, stating that his dream for peace has died while Hashirama's dream for peace lives on and will always keep living on as it is the better of the two. Before dying, he acknowledges the friendship of Hashirama and agrees with him when he said, that they are still friends despite everything.[22]

In other media
Madara appears in the original video animation Hashirama Senju vs. Madara Uchiha (2012); Obito narrates the origin of Konoha. In the beginning, ninja fought for their own clans. The most powerful among them are two clans: the Senju led by Hashirama, and the Uchiha led by Madara. This was distributed as part of the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[23] Although Obito impersonates Madara, the character made his debut in a video game in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3.[24] His Ten-Tailed Beast Host incarnation also appears in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.[25] In The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), Madara appears for a brief moment to be seen fighting with Hashirama They are depicted as the reincarnation of Indra and Ashura, which gradually leads to the final battle between Sasuke and Naruto. Madara also appears in the iOS and Android mobile game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing.[26] Apart from the Naruto games, the character also appears in the crossover fighting games J-Stars Victory VS and Jump Force as downloadable content.[27][28]

Several merchandise items based on Madara have been released, including key chains,[29] action figures,[30] and many more items.[31]

Reception
Madara has been a popular character from the Naruto series. He is featured in most of the powerful anime character lists from different anime reviewers. Comic Book Resources listed him third on their list of "25 Most Powerful Anime Villains", praising his strength.[32] Comic Book Resources also featured him on their list of "10 Anime Characters Who Got Stronger After Coming Back From The Dead" and gave him the ninth spot.[33] Comic Vine rated him 34th on their "Top 100 Anime Villains" list.[34] TheGamer, a news website focused on video game journalism, however, ranks him at fifth on their list titled "Final Form: The 25 Strongest Anime Villains Ever, Officially Ranked".[35] Madara is also sixth on Screen Rant's list titled "20 Most Powerful Naruto Characters, Ranked"; author Bobby Anhalt writes that, "Madara Uchiha is a force to be taken seriously."[36] UK Anime Network felt Madara's introduction was one of the franchise's strongest developments not only for the direction he took fight scenes but because of his effect on the main storyline.[37] His next battle against the five Kages, the leaders of each ninja village, also earned acclaim for its execution, making the final story arc more appealing. UK Anime's reviewer also liked Naruto's fight against Obito which began in the same narrative.[38] The Fandom Post praised this fight, noted how each Kage tries to defeat Madara on their own, but he is overwhelming does not care about his rivals.[39] Siliconera enjoyed Madara's moves from the video game Storm 4 based on the his Susanoo technique which was appealing to see in combat.[40] Anime News Network author Amy McNulty, in her review of episode 392 from the anime, writes that Madara has been built up as the ultimate villain for Naruto, and he is living up to that promise.[41] Jason Thompson, also writing for Anime News Network criticized the character calling Madara a "jerk"; but he liked his perfect Sussano'o, which to him looks cooler than the others and is much more powerful.[42]

Madara's origins received a good response. Screen Rant, in their article "15 Things You Didn't Know About Madara", pointed out that the power that Madara sought eventually took over his innocence that was once a part of him. They also praised some of his good qualities including his ideas about gender, money, and power. While describing his love for his brother Izuna, they compared it with Itachi's for Sasuke. According to Screen Rant, Madara is "one of the best evil characters in the series".[43] When first seeing Madara's past, The Fandom Post enjoyed the chaos between the Uchiha and Senju clans. Despite fighting through wars, Madara still showed humanity to the point the reviewer hoped for a spin-off based on the war.[44] In its next review, The Fandom Post enjoyed how his relationship with Hashirama was handled. When Hashirama tried offering him peace it gave the series more of a back story as it focused on the characters' past and the founding of the Hidden Leaf village.[45] Another reviewer from the same site noted that these backstories also helped fans understand the chaos that occurred within the Uchiha clan, which was previously explored in the stories of Sasuke and Itachi. Sasuke needed to resolve whether or not to team up with Madara and destroy the ninja world, leading to his decision to stick with Itachi's ideals instead.[46]

Some critics disliked the handling of the character. In an article from Screen Rant, titled "15 Things Wrong With Naruto We All Choose To Ignore", author Daniel Forster criticized Black Zetsu's betrayal to Madara saying he found Kaguya a poor substitute for Madara who was noted for coming across as a well-developed antagonist.[47] Anime News Network's Amy McNulty, however, thought that this was not that annoying, but she was unsure if it was a smart decision by Kishimoto to have Zetsu stab Madara, who was a genius and who believed Zetsu was "his will incarnate".[48] Comic Book Resources author Renaldo Matadeen criticized the handling of Madara as a villain despite appearing late in the story, and found his characterization weak.[49] While agreeing that Kaguya should not have replaced Madara as the final villain for the Shinobi War, Anime UK News felt that Kaguya was more fleshed out in the anime adaptation making her unique in terms of origins compared with Madara's past. Her descendants had a closer relationship with the protagonists, Naruto and Sasuke.[50]
