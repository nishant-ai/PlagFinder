Reinforcement learning is one of the subfields of machine learning. The machine learning model can gain abilities to make decisions and explore in an unsupervised and complex environment by reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning models use rewards for their actions to reach their goal/mission/task for what they are used to. So, reinforcement learning is different from supervised and unsupervised learning models. Reward rules are determined in the reinforcement learning algorithms. The agent of the model tries to reach maximum rewards by its actions. The algorithm starts with trials and learns to make decisions by itself to gain maximum rewards. Reinforcement learning models can gain experience and feedbacks (rewards) from their actions which help them to improve their results. This machine learning approach can be best explained with computer games.Reinforcement learning may be a key player for further development and the future of AI. So, the interest in reinforcement learning has been continuing for the last five years. The machine learning domain has been improving reinforcement learning models with new areas such as deep reinforcement learning, associative reinforcement learning, and inverse reinforcement learning. The interest in reinforcement learning is seen below from the chart.There are five key elements of reinforcement learning models: Different algorithms and approaches are used in the reinforcement learning models. Some of them are listed below. There is a simple flow for the agent–environment interaction in a Markov decision process below. A large amount of data is required for reinforcement learning models. That means it is not applied in the areas which have limited data, but it may be ideal for robotics and industrial automation and building computer games. Reinforcement learning algorithms have the ability to make sequential decisions and learn from their experience. That is their distinguishing feature from traditional machine learning models. Common areas where reinforcement learning is used are listed below:Reinforcement learning is not a new area in machine learning and the progress is still continuing despite the challenges. Those challenges are summarized below: For more on different types of machine learning approaches, feel free to read our other articles: If you have questions about reinforcement learning, we would like to help: How useful was this post?
