Computer vision is the field of study surrounding how computers see and understand digital images and videos. Computer vision spans all tasks performed by biological vision systems, including "seeing" or sensing a visual stimulus, understanding what is being seen, and extracting complex information into a form that can be used in other processes. This interdisciplinary field simulates and automates these elements of human vision systems using sensors, computers, and machine learning algorithms. Computer vision is the theory underlying artificial intelligence systems' ability to see and understand their surrounding environment. There are many examples of computer vision applied because its theory spans any area where a computer will see its surroundings in some form. Below are examples of computer vision: - Businesses and personal electronics use facial recognition technology to "see" who is trying to gain access to something. It has become a powerful security tool.The world's most comprehensivedata science & artificial intelligenceglossaryGet the week's mostpopular data scienceresearch in your inbox -every SaturdayGeometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges
