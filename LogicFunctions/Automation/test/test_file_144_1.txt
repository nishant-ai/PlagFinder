 The error is the sum of the Euclidean distance between points and the line.When it has only one independent variable, then it is termed as simple linear regression and is given by:While when it has more than one independent variable, it is termed as multiple linear regression. And is given byIn both, the above equation y is the dependent variable while x is the independent variable.It is a classification algorithm. In the support vector machine, we use a hyperplane to classify the Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series mainly adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga series, with exactly 500 episodes. It is set two and a half years after the original series in the Naruto universe, following the ninja teenager Naruto Uzumaki and his allies. The series is directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Pierrot and TV Tokyo. It began broadcasting on February 15, 2007 on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.[1][2]

On January 2, 2009, Viz Media and Crunchyroll provided eight uncut English subtitled Naruto: Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website.[3] Later on January 15, Viz began providing subtitled versions of the latest Naruto: Shippuden episodes a week after they first aired in Japan, with a new episode being added to the Naruto website each subsequent Thursday.[3] The English dub of Naruto: Shippuden made its US premiere on Disney XD on October 28, 2009.[4][5][6] On July 24, 2009, Viz Media announced that the series would be released on the iTunes Store.[7] The first DVD release of the series in North America was released on September 29, 2009.[8]

Naruto: Shippuden stopped airing on Disney XD on November 5, 2011 after 98 episodes, in which the network cited more frequent violence that was shown in later episodes.[9] DVD box sets generally containing thirteen dubbed episodes from episode 1 onward were released quarterly in their uncut format.[10][11] The English dub was streamed on the Neon Alley web channel from its launch in October 2012, and beginning December 29, 2012 with episode 99, dubbed episodes premiered every week uncut until March 25, 2016 after 338 episodes, about a month before Neon Alley's closure. Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing the anime from the beginning on January 5, 2014 in an uncut format and as of 2021 it is still running on a weekly basis.[12] The network started showing never before aired dubbed episodes at the 339th episode mark by May 2021.

In four regions, episodes from the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray by single volumes and box sets. In North America, twelve single volumes and thirty eight box sets have been released. In the United Kingdom, twenty eight single volumes and six box sets have been released. In Japan, twenty six sets of volumes have been released based on which arc it represents. In Australia and New Zealand, twenty-eight collections have been released.We will pass the images to the input layers. Since the number of pixels in the image is 32×32 = 1024, we will have 1024 neurons in the input layers. The number of neurons in hidden layers can be tweaked, but for the output layer, it has to be 10 since, in this example, the number can be anything between 0-9.The node of the output layers contains the probability. Whichever node has the highest probability that the node is supposed to be the resultant class?The decision tree got its name from the fact that it builds classification or regression models in the form of tree structures. It breaks down the dataset into a smaller subset and associate decision with it. As a result, we get a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node can have two or more branches and will lead you to the leaf nodes. A leaf node is used to represent the classification or decision. It uses the if-then-else decision rule to approximate the result. The deeper we go down in the tree, the more complex its rules will become, which will also result in the fitter model.Naïve base is a collection of classification algorithms, I.e. based on Bayes theorem. They all work on the same principle, i.e. none of the features is dependent on each other.
