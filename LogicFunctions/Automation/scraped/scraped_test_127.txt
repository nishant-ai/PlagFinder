Last Updated on August 20, 2020What is supervised machine learning and how does it relate to unsupervised machine learning?In this post you will discover supervised learning, unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. After reading this post you will know:Kick-start your project with my new book Master Machine Learning Algorithms, including step-by-step tutorials and the Excel Spreadsheet files for all examples.Let’s get started.Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning AlgorithmsPhoto by US Department of Education, some rights reserved.The majority of practical machine learning uses supervised learning.Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.Y = f(X)The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.Sample of the handy machine learning algorithms mind map.I've created a handy mind map of 60+ algorithms organized by type.Download it, print it and use it. Also get exclusive access to the machine learning algorithms email mini-course.  Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.Some common types of problems built on top of classification and regression include recommendation and time series prediction respectively.Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are:Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.Unsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.Some popular examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are:Problems where you have a large amount of input data (X) and only some of the data is labeled (Y) are called semi-supervised learning problems.These problems sit in between both supervised and unsupervised learning.A good example is a photo archive where only some of the images are labeled, (e.g. dog, cat, person) and the majority are unlabeled.Many real world machine learning problems fall into this area. This is because it can be expensive or time-consuming to label data as it may require access to domain experts. Whereas unlabeled data is cheap and easy to collect and store.You can use unsupervised learning techniques to discover and learn the structure in the input variables.You can also use supervised learning techniques to make best guess predictions for the unlabeled data, feed that data back into the supervised learning algorithm as training data and use the model to make predictions on new unseen data.In this post you learned the difference between supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. You now know that:Do you have any questions about supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning? Leave a comment and ask your question and I will do my best to answer it....with just arithmetic and simple examplesDiscover how in my new Ebook: 
Master Machine Learning AlgorithmsIt covers explanations and examples of 10 top algorithms, like:
Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and much more...Skip the Academics. Just Results.Thanks for this post. That was helpful. My question is how does one determine the correct algorithm to use for a particular problem in supervised learning? Also,can a network trained by unsupervised learning be tested with new set of data (testing data) or its just for the purpose of grouping?Hi Omot, it is a good idea to try a suite of standard algorithms on your problem and discover what algorithm performs best.Normally, an unsupervised method is applied to all data available in order to learn something about that data and the broader problem. You could say cluster a “training” dataset and later see what clusters new data is closest to if you wanted to avoid re-clustering the data.sir, does k-means clustering can be implemented in MATLAB to predict the data for unsupervised learning.k-means is a clustering algorithm. It is not used to make predictions, instead it is used to group data. Learn more here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clusteringHello Could clustering be used to create a dependent categorical variable from a number of numerical independent variables?
I am faced with a problem where i have a dataset with multiple independent numerical columns but i am not sure whether the dependent variable is correct.Sure. Try it and see if it helps.Hi, Sabarish v!
here you can better understand about k-algorithm, explained very wellhttps://blog.carbonteq.com/practical-image-recognition-with-tensorflow/Thanks for sharing.Which of the following is a supervised learning problem?
 A) Grouping people in a social network.
 B) Predicting credit approval based on historical data
 C) Predicting rainfall based on historical data
 D) all of the aboveI’d rather not do your homework for you.This framework can help you figure whether any problem is a supervised learning problem:

I have utilized all resources available and the school can’t find a tutor in this subject.  My question is this: What is the best method to choose if you want to train an algorithm that can discriminate between patients with hypertension and patients with hypertension and diabetes. Please help me understand!Hi Angel, this sounds like a problem specific problem. In general, we cannot know which data representation is best or which algorithm is best, they must be discovered empirically:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-data-driven-approach-to-machine-learning/I teach a process for working through predictive modeling problems methodically that you may find useful:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#processvery informing article that tells differences between supervised and unsupervised learning!
thanks!Thanks.You can optimize your algorithm or compare between algorithms using Cross validation which in the case of supervised learning tries to find the best data to use for training and testing the algorithm.This content is really helpful. Can you give some examples of all these techniques with best description?? or a brief introduction of Reinforcement learning with example??Take a look at this post for a good list of algorithms:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/Hi Jason, Thank you for summary on types of ML algorithms
How can one use clustering or unsupervised learning for prediction on a new data. I have clustered the input data into clusters using hierarchical clustering, Now I want to check the membership of new data with the identified clusters. How is it possible. Is there an algorithm available in R?Hi Naveen, generally I don’t use unsupervised methods much as I don’t get much value from them in practice.You can use the cluster number, cluster centroid or other details as an input for modeling.Could you please give me a real world example of supervised, unsupervised, and semi supervised learning?Hi Tashrif,Supervised would be when you have a ton of labeled pictures of dogs and cats and you want to automatically label new pictures of dogs and cats.Unsupervised would be when you want to see how the pictures structurally relate to each other by color or scene or whatever.Semi-supervised is where you have a ton of pictures and only some are labelled and you want to use the unlabeled and the labelled to help you in turn label new pictures in the future.This was a really good read, so thanks for writing and publishing it.Question for you.  I have constructed a Random Forest model, so I’m using supervised learning, and I’m being asked to run an unlabeled data set through it.  But I won’t have the actual results of this model, so I can’t determine accuracy on it until I have the actual result of it.So my question is… how can I run a set of data through a ML model if I don’t have labels for it?  For further clarity and context, I’m running a random forest model to predict a binary classification label.  I get the first few data points relatively quickly, but the label takes 30 days to become clear.Maybe none of this makes sense, but I appreciate any direction you could possibly give.Many thanks,FrankThanks Frank. Great question.You will need to collect historical data to develop and evaluate your model.Once created, it sounds like you will need to wait 30 days before you can evaluate the ongoing performance of the model’s predictions.Hi Jason,
Have done a program to classify if a customer(client) will subscribe for term deposit or not..

thanks in advanceHi Ann, great work!You can compare each algorithm using a consistent testing methodology. For example k-fold cross validation with the same random number seeds (so each algorithm gets the same folds).Here is more info on comparing algorithms:

I want to find an online algorithm to cluster scientific workflow data to minimize run time and system overhead so it can map these workflow tasks to a distributed resources like clouds .The clustered data should be mapped to these available resources in a balanced way that  guarantees no resource is over utilized while other resource is idle. I came a cross a horizontal clustering ,vertical clustering but these technique  are static and user should determine the number of clusters and number of tasks in each cluster in advance …Hi Sam, Thanks for your support.Off-the-cuff, this sounds like a dynamic programming or constraint satisfaction problem rather than machine learning.Hi Jason, this post is really helpful for my Cognitive Neural Network revision!I have a question of a historical nature, relating to how supervised learning algorithms evolved:
Some early supervised learning methods allowed the threshold to be adjusted during learning. Why is that not necessary with the newer supervised learning algorithms?Is this because they (e.g. the Delta Rule) adjust the weights on a running basis to minimize error, which supersedes the need for threshold adjustment? Or is there something more subtle going on in the newer algorithms that eliminates the need for threshold adjustment? Thank you in advance for any insight you can provide on this.I don’t think I have enough context Marcus. It sounds like you may be referring specifically to stochastic gradient descent.I’m not really an algorithm historian, I’d refer you to the seminal papers on the topic.Hi Jason – Thanks so much for the informative post.  I think I am missing something basic.  Once a model is trained with labeled data (supervised), how does additional unlabeled data help improve the model?  For example, how do newly uploaded pictures (presumably unlabeled) to Google Photos help further improve the model (assuming it does so)?  Or how does new voice data (again unlabeled) help make a machine learning-based voice recognition system better? i understand conceptually how labeled data could drive a model but unclear how it helps if you don’t really know what the data represents.   Thanks! DaveGreat question Dave.Generally, we can use unlabelled data to help initialize large models, like deep neural networks.More specifically, we can label unlabelled data, have it corroborate the prediction if needed, and use that as input to update or retrain a model to make be better for future predictions.Does that help?yes thanks.  So the data ultimately needs to be labeled to be useful in improving the model?  Keeping with the Google Photos use case, all the millions of photos uploaded everyday then doesn’t help the model unless someone manually labels them and then runs those through the training?  Guess I was hoping there was some way intelligence could be discerned from the unlabeled data (unsupervised) to improve on the original model but that does not appear to be the case right?  thanks again for the help – DaveThere very well may be, I’m just not across it.For a business which uses machine learning, would it be correct to think that there are employees who manually label unlabeled data to overcome the problem raised by Dave? The amount of unlabeled data in such cases would be much smaller than all the photos in Google Photos.It is a good approach, e.g. to use local or remote labor to prepare/label a first-cut dataset.Can you write a blog post on Reinforcement Learning explaining how does it work, in context of Robotics ?I hope to cover the topic in the future Rohit.Hi Jason,I am trying to solve machine learning problem for Incidents in Health & safety industry.

simple and easy to understand contents.
I am an ML enthusiast looking for material that groups important and most used algorithms in to supervised and unsupervised. e.g
Supervised – Regression, Classification, Decision tree etc..
Unsupervised – Cluster, etc..do you  have ?This might help:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/You could look at this video about unsupervised learning. It shows some examples were unsupervised learning is typically used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulpnydYxg8Given data on how 1000 medical patients respond to an experiment drug( such as effectiveness of treatment, side effects) discover whether there are different categories or types of patients in terms of how they respond to the drug and if so what these categories are. Is this supervised or unsupervised learning ?Sounds like unsupervised to me.I have over 1million sample input queries.. I want to classify into genuine or malicious query.. Every query consist of keywords but there are some specific keywords that may help identify malicious query or not. However not every of the possible malicious keyword may consider the whole query malicious… I’m not sure how to present my problem here but Let me ask this first… Is it possible to have 2 levels of classification(supervised) and 1 level of clustering(unsupervised) in solving a problem like this..?You need a high-quality training dataset first.Then this process may help:

I have a question. Does an unsupervised algorithm search for a final hypothesis and if so, what is the hypothesis used for. Are target functions involved in unsupervised learning? What does an unsupervised algorithm actually do?
I understand supervised learning as an approach where training data is fed into an algorithm to learn the hypothesis that estimates the target function. However, for an unsupervised learning, for example, clustering, what does the clustering algorithm actually do? what does “concept learning” mean when it comes to unsupervised machine learning? I noticed that most books define concept learning with respect to supervised learning. Thank youI don’t like unsupervised methods in general – I don’t find their results objective – I don’t think they are falsifiable therefore I can’t judge if they’re useful.They work by applying a methodology/process to data to get an outcome, then it is up to the practitioner to interpret the results – hopefully objectively.You’ll notice that I don’t cover unsupervised learning algorithms on my blog – this is the reason.Hi Jason,I am following your Tutorials from Last couple of weeks. Thanks for such awesome Tutorials for beginners. I have one problem for which I want to use ML algorithm. I tried Cats and Dogs for small dataset and I can predict correct output with Binary Cross entropy.Now To apply to my own dataset problem I want to classify images as Weather they are Cat or Dog or any other(if I provide Lion image). But all I get is only 0 & 1 for cat and dog class.Model.predict should give me different output if image is not cat or dog.
Also , How Can I get % prediction that says. Yes this image is quite similar to cat/dot with test result accuracy  as 80% or more. If I provide mountain/lion image then it should give me output as it is 10% or less than 50% so I can say it is not cat or dog but something other??You will need to change your model from a binary classification model to a multiclass classification model.See this model as an example:

One of them is a free text and another one is a sentiment score, from 1 (negative) to 10 (positive).I’m trying to apply a sentiment analysis to the text field and see how well it works comparing with the sentiment score field. For this purpose, I’ve run some off-the-self sentiment analysis tools, such as Polyglot, but they didn’t work very well. That’s why I’ve decided to address this as a classification problem (negative, neutral or positive). In order to do this, I’ve got 1, 2 and 3-grams and I’ve used them as features to train my model. I tried with SVM and also getting the most representative grams for each of these classes using z-score, but the results were worst than with Polyglot.Any suggestion?Thanks!This tutorials will get you started:

Secondly, Beside these two areas, are there other areas you think AI will be helpful for industrialists. Let me know you take.ChibuzorI’m not sure how these methods could help with archiving.Perhaps this post will help you define your problem as a supervised learning problem:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/Hi,
Interesting read.Do you have a suggestion for where for a given input (image) choosing a particular point p gives a reward r. the goal is to maximize r. There may me multiple points that return the same maximum r value, so I don’t see standard a cnn training methods working. It does not matter which one is returned the reward is the same. Each trial is separate so reinforcement learning does not seem correct.Sounds like a multimodal optimization problem. If you only need one result, one of a range of stochastic optimization algorithms can be used.If you need all points, then a multimodal optimizaiton could be used, like a niching genetic algorithm (I did my masters on these).Very Helping Material i was preparing for my exams and i have completely understood the whole concept it was very smoothly explained JAZAKALLA (Means May GOD give you HIS blessing )I’m glad it helped.you can give me  an explanation about the classes of unsupervised methods: by block, by pixel, by region which used in the segmentation.Sorry, I don’t follow. Perhaps you can provide more context?sir, can you tell real time example on supervised,unsupervised,semisupervisedLinear regression is supervised, clustering is unsupervised, autoencoders can be used in an semisupervised manner.Sir, thank u for such a great information.
But how can we use unsupervised learning for any type of clustering?Sorry, I don’t have material on clustering. I may cover it in the future.Thanks for posting this.  This is a great summary!  Very straightforward explanations.I’m glad it helped.First of all very nice and helpfull report, and then my question.I have an unsupervised dataset with people and i want to find some paterns about their behaviour for future marketing. I am using clustering algorythms but then if i want to train a model for future predictions (for a new entry in the dataset, or for a new transaction of an already registered person in the dataset) should i use these clusters as classes to train the model as supervised classification? Or how can i do this? i am confused. Thank you in advance!!Perhaps start with a clear idea of the outcomes you require and work backwards:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/Thank you for your reply, but this couldnt help me too much.. Some people, after a clustering method in a unsupervised model ex. k-means use the k-means prediction to predict the cluster that a new entry belong. But some other after finding the clusters, train a new classifier ex. as the problem is now supervised with the clusters as classes, And use this classifier to predict the class or the cluster of the new entry. I cant understand the difference bettween these two methods. I dont know if you understand my point but i would appreciate if you try to explain it to me..Sorry, I don’t have material on clustering, I cannot give you good advice.Thank You for the giving better explanation.I’m glad it helped.given that some students information such as(Name,Address,GPA-1,GPA-2, and Grade),,,,my job is to “divide students based on their grade”…..so my question is the this job is supervise or unsupervised learning? and which Machine learning algorithm is perfect to do this job…I thing it will be Unsupervised learning but i am confused about what algorithm perfect for this job….(is it clustering)… am i right sir?This post might help you determine whether it is a supervised learning problem:

http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/could you explain semi supervised machine learning a bit more with examples.Thanks for the suggestion. This might be a good place to start:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learningDear prof Brownlee:          From my understanding, method based on unsupervised leaning(no labels required) can’t compare with those based on supervised leaning(labels required) since their comparison premise is different. I f one wants to compare them, one should put them under the same problem scenarios,only this way, comparison is reasonable and fair,isn’i it? but provided that the problem scenarios are applictions without labels, they can’t compare with each other since supervised leaning methods need lables to train models,but now there are no labels to be trained, therefore I think it is unreasonable and infeasible to compare method based on unsupervised leaning with those based on supervised leaning,is it right? I want to know your views, thank you!Yes, they are not comparable. They solve different problems.Hi Jason,Your article was very informative and cleared lot of my concepts.

I would love to follow you and your articles further.Thanks.I never understood what the semi-supervised machine learning is, until I read your post. The issue was whether we can have new labels after processing or we are based only on the first given labels. The example you gave made it all clear. So, the answer is, we don’t have all the labels, that’s why we join unlabeled data. Thank you for your great posts!Thanks.Hey Jason,Love your books and articles.

Is it possible to create a data model such that I have ‘ONE’ data repository and 2 machine learning algorithms, say Logistic regression and Random Forest? The data repository is getting populated every minute (like in an information system) but after a span of 15 minutes, it is processed via Logistic Regression, and after the next 15 minutes, it is processed via Random Forest, and so on. My questions would be:
1. Is it possible to create such a system?
2. If yes, would this allow to gain benefits of both algorithms? If no, is there any alternative way to achieve this?Sure, I don’t see why not. The question is why would you want to do this?Well, I wanted to know if that can be regarded as an extension to ensemble modelling.I think some data critical applications, including IoT communication (let’s say, the domain of signal estimation for 5G, vehicle to vehicle communication) and information systems can make use of a cross check with multiple data models. In this way, the deficiencies of one model can be overcome by the other. Of course it would not be a memory/ hardware efficient solution, but just saying.If you have seen anything like this, a system where more than one data models are being used in one place, I would really appreciate you sharing it, thanks.In an ensemble, the output of two methods would be combined in some way in order to make a prediction.Hello, great job explaining all kind of MLA. but I am confused on where we can put the SVM in the Algorithms Mind Map?Thanks!Perhaps under instance based methods?I have learned up to machine learning algorithms,
now what is the next step to learn,i.e. which technology should i learn first
e.g. deep learning,opencv,NLP,neural network,or  image detection.
plz tell me step by step which one is interlinked and what should learn first.thanksPerhaps select a topic that most interests you or a topic that you can apply immediately:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/Hello,
I looked through your post because I have to use the Findex dataset from World Bank to get some information for my thesis on the factors influencing financial and digital inclusion of women. I’m thinking of using K-clustering for this project. I would like to get your input on this.Thank youIt really depends on the goals of your project.Perhaps this framework will help:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/Hello JasonFirst of all thank you for the post. I’m working on a subject about identifying fake profiles on some social networks, the data that i have is unlabeled so i’m using unsupervised learning, but i need to do also a supervised learning. So my question is: can i label my data using the unsupervised learning at first so I can easily use it for supervised learning??Unsupervised learning can propose clusters, but you must still label data using an expert.Hi Jason, the information you provided was really helpful. I have a question, which machine learning algorithm is best suited for forensics investigation?This is a common question that I answer here:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/what-algorithm-config-should-i-useDear Jason,its been mentioned above that Supervised: ‘All data is labeled’.But its not mentioned that what does it mean that data is labeled or not?
if one get this kind of query while going through purchased e book, is there any support provided???
Note: For now I assume that labeled data mean for certain input X , output is /should be Y.Regards,
RandhirA label might be a class or it might be a target quantity.Hi  Jason,do you have any algorithm example for supervised learning and unsupervised learning?thank youI have many hundreds of examples, perhaps start here:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/Hi Jason, thanks for this great post. Do supervised methods use any unlabeled data at all? Or is the performance of the model evaluated on the basis of its classification (for categorical data) of the test data only? I am working on a project where I want to compare the performance of several supervised methods (SVMs, logistic regression, ensemble methods, random forests, and nearest neighbors) and one semi-supervised method (naive Bayes) in identifying a rare outcome, and I have about 2 million labeled records (split between training and test sets) and 200 million unlabeled records.Supervised learning models are evaluated on unseen data where we know the output.Thanks for this amazing post. I have read your many post.Thanks, I’m glad it helped.Thanks for the interested post, is great contribution on machine learning domain God bless youThanks.Hi Jason,
With unlabelled data, if we do kmeans and find the labels, now the data got labels, can we proceed to do supervised learning.
Thanksk-means will find clusters, not labels.Labels must be assigned by a domain expert.Thanks Jason, if they say there is going to be two clusters, then we build kmeans with K as 2, we get two clusters, in this case is this possible to continue supervised learning.Just to be more explainable, kmeansmodel = KMeans(n_clusters= 2)
kmeansmodel.fit(X_train)
predicted = kmeansmodel.labels_
kmf2labels = predicted.tolist()
raw_data[‘labels’] = kmf2labels Now we get labels as 0 and 1, so can we binary classification now.Yes.It may be.Thanks Jason, whether the supervised classification after unsupervised will improve our prediction results, may I have your comments please?It depends on the data and the model.The best that I can say is: try it and see.Hi Jason,
The DBSCAN model running into MemoryError(with 32GB RAM and 200,000 records, 60 Columns), may I know is there a solution for thisdbscan_model = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=5, metric=’euclidean’, algorithm=’auto’)
dbscan_model.fit(X_scaled)I tried like splitting the data based on ONE categorical column, say Employed(Yes and No), so these two dataset splits getting 105,000 and 95000 records, so I build two models, for prediction if the test record is Employed Yes i run the model_Employed_Yes or other, NOT sure is this a good choice to do?
ThanksPerhaps try operating on a sample of the dataset?Perhaps try running on an EC2 instance with more memory?Perhaps try exploring a more memory efficient implementation?Hi
I used this note in my paper.
How can I reference it?
please help meGreat question, I show how here:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/how-do-i-reference-or-cite-a-book-or-blog-postThank you so much. I have one more question. Do we have the primal SVM function?
what is it?What is the “primal SVM function”? Do you mean the kernel?yes. the kernelPerhaps start here:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/support-vector-machines-for-machine-learning/thank you sir, this post is very helpful for me. sir i have a doubt. Is  unsupervised learning have dataset or not?Yes, unsupervised learning has a training dataset only.Training or testing?Yes.Hello sir. Thank you so much for this helping material.
Sir one problem i am facing that how can i identify the best suitable algorithm/model for a scenario.
For example i have an image and i want to find the values of three variables by ML model so which model can i use.Input: image
Output: concentration of variable 1, 2, 3 in an image.Perhaps try a range of CNN models for image classification?This might be a good place to start:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#dlfcvi think the solution to unsupervised learning is to make a program that just takes photos from camera and then let the network reconstruct what ever total image that its confronted with by random and use this for method for its training. as far as i understand the network can reconstruct lots of images from fragments stored in the network. that means by take a snap shot of what camera sees and feed that as training data could pehaps solve unsupervised learning. this way the network automatically aquire it own training data. what i mean is not to classify data directly as that will keep you stuck in the supervised learning limbo.it will not be enough with one network. the reason is that it takes two players to share information. the network can’t read itself at the same time as it reconstruct as that obliterate the image its reconstructing from.what you need  is a second network that can reconstruct what the first network is showing. its not this simple either. you can not solve the problem by this alone as the network can only output a single image at the time so we need to break down the image into smaller parts and then let one network get a random piece to reconstruct the whole from the total image of the other networks reconstruction. by randomly trow the ball of part of the image between the networks, you have comunication between them. this way, you can make a dream like process with infinite possible images.
now you need a third network that can get random images received from the two other networks and use the input image data from the camera as images to compare the random suggestions from the two interchanging networks with the reconstruction from the third network from camera image. this way the machine will self classify the data that fits with the external image. what we need now is to brand these random images labels by marry the sound data or transelation of sound to speach with the random images from the two recursive mirrors secondary network to one primary by a algorithm that can take the repetition of recognized words done by another specialized network and indirectly use the condition for the recognition of the sound data as a trigger to take a snapshot of camera and reconstruct that image and then compare that image by the random recursive mirrors. if it found the image of the target in the camera in the random recursive network, you can then use a conventional algoritm to classify the recognized word with the recognized image. this way the machine will learn and teach itself information that over time will make it able to recall classified objects you did not teach it.this is not the solution of the whole problem. you do not have  Artificial General Intelligence yet. there is still a big problem left. you now have to find a way to make the software make comunication with people so that it can learn from their thinking and learn how to say things.what you have from before is just a very intelligent dream machine that learns.now we have to reverse the process. now we have to take input data from a person verbally and use the classifications the computer created by itself to reconstruct image in the main network. this way we are half way into letting the network learn from your verbal language by dive into its own network for information to create new and more classifications by itself using its previous methods. at this point you have created a very clever low iq program that only mirrors your saying like a evolved monkey.in order to solve this you have to increase the complexity of the networks by take the primary network and make it seconday and then create a new network that can act as the top of the triangle and make 6 seconday network that mimic the main network. these 6 networks will be handles to store parts of information that can make suggestions to compare to the main network output. this way you have 6 networks that contain pattern where they can compete for the better question or answer.  what ever it made  the program smarter i don’t know. byond this im clueless. anyway this is just an idea. if this is to complicated, there is no way in the world anyone will ever solve the problem of unsupervised learning that leads to agi.Thanks for sharing.Are supervised and unsupervised algorithms another way of defining parametric and nonparametric algorithms?No.Some supervised algorithms are parametric, some are nonparametric.Some unsupervised algorithms are parametric, some are nonparametric.great work,sir can you give example how supervised learning is used to test software components.
means how to do testing of software with supervised learning . any example will be helpfulThanks for the suggestion.Sir can you help me how to do testing with supervised learning. Please give any example. I am facing problem in itYes, there are hundreds of examples on the blog. Perhaps start here:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/You did a really good job with this.  I like it a lot. 🙂Thanks!ery informing article that tells differences between supervised and unsupervised learning!
thanks!You’re welcome!Hey Jason! Great article! I’m currently working on a Supervised/Unsupervised Learning Project for one of my MBA classes. For the project we have to identify a problem in our workplace that can be solved using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. I work for a digital marketing agency that builds and manages marketing campaigns for small to mid size business (PPC, SEO, Facebook Ads, Display Ads, etc). For my unsupervised learning model I was thinking of solving the problem of customer churn before it gets to that point. I would use K-means Clustering and the features/columns for the model would be:– the reason for the cancellation
– how many months the client ran with us before cancelling. (Whenever someone cancels with us we choose from a list of cancellation reasons within our CRM.) The rows would be the type of marketing channel that the client was running. By clustering this data we would be able to see what types of cancellations to look for at various stages of a customer life cycle, broken down by each marketing channel.Does this problem make sense for Unsupervised Learning and if so do I need to add more features for it or is two enough? Thanks for taking the time to read this!Churn prediction is a supervised learning problem. Clustering could be used as a pre-processing step.I see. Could you expand on what you mean by clustering being used as a pre-processing step?Yes, as you describe, you could group customers based on behavior in an unsupervised way, then fit a model on each group or use group membership as an input to a supervised learning model.It may or may not be helpful, depending on the complexity of the problem and chosen model, e.g. most supervised learning models would do something like this anyway.Ok so outside of the part where I talk about using the Unsupervised Model to predict churn everything else I said would work for Unsupervised Learning? (The features/rows I outlined)It is impossible to know what the most useful features will be. I recommend running some experiments to see what works for your dataset.This might give you ideas about what data to collect:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/interesting post. now suggest me algorithms in unsupervised learning to detect malicious/phishing url and legitimate url.That sounds like a supervised learning problem.Thank you so much for such amazing post, very easy understand ……Thank YouYou’re welcome!brilliant read, but i am stuck on something; is it possible to append data on supervised learning models?Thanks!Sure, you can update or refit the model any time you want.Hi, I have to predict student performance of a specific class and i collected all other demographic and previous class data of students. So in this case either i apply supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm.It sounds like supervised learning, this framework will help:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-define-your-machine-learning-problem/which one is better supervised and unsupervised machine learning?Invalid dichotomy. They are two different classes of technique for solving different problems.If you had to chose one to study that would be most useful “at work”, it would be: supervised learning.Hi Jason,Well structured write that has finally cleared some misconceptions. I wanted to find out where future predictions will fall under.So say I had a variable, Y_p and 3 input variables X1, X2, X3, in my data set but I wanted to predict a future Y value, let’s call it Y_f. Would this be a supervised or unsupervised problem?For example, Y_p could be my current speed, X1, X2 and X3 could be weight, height, age and then Y_f would be the predicted (future speed) after a given period tLooking forward to your response.Thanks.Supervised.Thank you. What algorithms would be best suited to this problem? Given it is a regression problem. I find it a bit boggling in the sense that from my understanding of supervised, the target variable is usually known in the historic data (train set). however, for this problem, the target variable in the historic data isn’t known so perhaps you could point me in the direction where I can really understand why it is still a supervised learning problem and what algorithms best tackle this problem.Good question this will help:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/what-algorithm-config-should-i-useHi Jason,Is there any algorithm out there which can perform unsupervised multiclass multi label problems? I know that Kmeans can be used for unsupervised multiclass problems. Is there any way they can be made to work on multi class multi label problems?No. Classification is a supervised learning problem, not unsupervised.Kmeans is not aware of classes, it is not a classification algorithm. It is a clustering algorithm and groups data into the number centers you specify.Hi Jason,
Does Knn require some initial labeled data, on which it can create clusters, or is it done by some other technique?Yes, the model requires a good representative labeled dataset for “training”.A simple and clear explanation. Thank youYou’re welcome!Thank you for this post.
I would like to know how can I train and test in unsupervised learning for image dataset: during training all the dataset is labeled and during test how datasets should be (should i get dataset with masks or only normal dataset)?
Thank youSorry, I don’t have examples of unsupervised learning.May I do the clustering on the image data.I guess so, you may need custom techniques designed for image data.i have doubt can u pls tell is this a supervised (classification) or unsupervised Predicting if a new image has cat or dog based on the historical data of other images of cats and dogs, where you are supplied the information about which image is cat or dogSupervised.Comment Name (required) Email (will not be published) (required) Website
