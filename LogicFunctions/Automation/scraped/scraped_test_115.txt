Computer vision allows machines to identify people, places, and things in images with accuracy at or above human levels with much greater speed and efficiency. Often built with deep learning models, it automates extraction, analysis, classification and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. The image data can take many forms, such as single images, video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or three-dimensional data.Applications are far-reaching, from identifying defects in high speed assembly lines - to autonomous robots - to the analysis of medical images - to identifying products and people in social media. Computer vision with image and facial recognition helps quickly identify unlawful entries or persons of interest, resulting in safer communities and a more effective way of deterring crimes.  Enhanced human-computer interaction improves customer satisfaction such as offering products based on customer sentiment analysis in retail outlets or faster banking services with quick authentication based on customer identity and preferences.  With millions of images added every day to media and social channels. The use of computer vision technologies such as metadata extraction and image classification greatly improves efficiency and revenue opportunities.   Using computer vision technologies. Auto manufacturers can provide improved and safer self-driving car navigation realizing the goal of making autonomous driving a reality and a reliable transportation option.   Medical image analysis with computer vision can greatly improve the accuracy and speed of a patient's medical diagnosis, resulting in better treatment outcomes and life expectancy.     Well-trained computer vision incorporated in robotics improves quality assurance and operational efficiencies in manufacturing applications, resulting in more reliable and cost effective products.
