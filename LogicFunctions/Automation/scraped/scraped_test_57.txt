What We InvestigateMalicious cyber activity threatens the public’s safety and our national and economic security. The FBI’s cyber strategy is to impose risk and consequences on cyber adversaries. Our goal is to change the behavior of criminals and nation-states who believe they can compromise U.S. networks, steal financial and intellectual property, and put critical infrastructure at risk without facing risk themselves. To do this, we use our unique mix of authorities, capabilities, and partnerships to impose consequences against our cyber adversaries. The FBI is the lead federal agency for investigating cyber attacks and intrusions. We collect and share intelligence and engage with victims while working to unmask those committing malicious cyber activities, wherever they are. Learn more about what you can do to protect yourself from cyber criminals, how you can report cyber crime, and the Bureau's efforts in combating the evolving cyber threat.﻿Learn how businesses and organizations can work with the FBI to get ahead of the threat and make an impact on our cyber adversaries.If you are the victim of online or internet-enabled crime, file a report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) as soon as possible. Crime reports are used for investigative and intelligence purposes. Rapid reporting can also help support the recovery of lost funds. Visit ic3.gov for more information, including tips and information about current crime trends.If you or your organization is the victim of a network intrusion, data breach, or ransomware attack, contact your nearest FBI field office or report it at tips.fbi.gov.Our adversaries look to exploit gaps in our intelligence and information security networks. The FBI is committed to working with our federal counterparts, our foreign partners, and the private sector to close those gaps.These partnerships allow us to defend networks, attribute malicious activity, sanction bad behavior, and take the fight to our adversaries overseas. The FBI fosters this team approach through unique hubs where government, industry, and academia form long-term trusted relationships to combine efforts against cyber threats.Within government, that hub is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF). The FBI leads this task force of more than 30 co-located agencies from the Intelligence Community and law enforcement. The NCIJTF is organized around mission centers based on key cyber threat areas and led by senior executives from partner agencies. Through these mission centers, operations and intelligence are integrated for maximum impact against U.S. adversaries.Only together can we achieve safety, security, and confidence in a digitally connected world.Whether through developing innovative investigative techniques, using cutting-edge analytic tools, or forging new partnerships in our communities, the FBI continues to adapt to meet the challenges posed by the evolving cyber threat.The FBI’s cyber strategy is to impose risk and consequences on cyber adversaries through our unique authorities, our world-class capabilities, and our enduring partnerships.

Vital partnerships like the National Cyber Forensics & Training Alliance have become an international model for bringing together law enforcement, private industry, and academia to build and share resources, strategic information, and threat intelligence to identify and stop emerging cyber threats and mitigate existing ones.01.04.2022Oregon FBI Tech Tuesday: Building a Digital Defense Against Google Voice Authentication Scams12.28.2021Oregon FBI Tech Tuesday: End of Year Scams12.22.2021Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Mitigating Log4Shell and Other Log4j-Related Vulnerabilities12.20.2021Russian National Extradited for Role in Hacking and Illegal Trading Scheme12.20.2021FBI Denver Warns Colorado and Wyoming Residents of Nationwide Phone Scam Where Caller Impersonates Law Enforcement12.15.2021FBI Statement on Log4j Vulnerability12.15.2021'Tis the Season for Holiday Online Shopping Scams—Don’t Be a Victim12.14.2021Oregon FBI Tech Tuesday: Building a Digital Defense Against Holiday Shipping Scams12.14.2021Minneapolis Man Sentenced to 60 Months in Prison for Cyberstalking12.13.2021Cyber Attack Against TheBus and TheHandi-Van

This type of encryption means the government often cannot obtain the electronic evidence necessary to investigate and prosecute threats to public and national safety, even with a warrant or court order.
