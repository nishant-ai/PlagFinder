Financial aid availableOffered ByThis course introduces you to one of the main types of modeling families of supervised Machine Learning: Classification. You will learn how to train predictive models to classify categorical outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different models. The hands-on section of this course focuses on using best practices for classification, including train and test splits, and handling data sets with unbalanced classes.By the end of this course you should be able to:
-Differentiate uses and applications of classification and classification ensembles
-Describe and use logistic regression models
-Describe and use decision tree and tree-ensemble models
-Describe and use other ensemble methods for classification
-Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select the classification model that best suits your data
-Use oversampling and undersampling as techniques to handle unbalanced classes in a data set
 
Who should take this course?
This course targets aspiring data scientists interested in acquiring hands-on experience with Supervised Machine Learning Classification techniques in a business setting.
 
What skills should you have?
To make the most out of this course, you should have familiarity with programming on a Python development environment, as well as fundamental understanding of Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics.IBM is the global leader in business transformation through an open hybrid cloud platform and AI, serving clients in more than 170 countries around the world.

Although more modern classifiers might likely output models with higher accuracy, logistic regressions are great baseline models due to their high interpretability and parametric nature. This module will walk you through extending a linear regression example into a logistic regression, as well as the most common error metrics that you might want to use to compare several classifiers and select that best suits your business problem.K Nearest Neighbors is a popular classification method because they are easy computation and easy to interpret. This module walks you through the theory behind k nearest neighbors as well as a demo for you to practice building k nearest neighbors models with sklearn.This module will walk you through the main idea of how support vector machines construct hyperplanes to map your data into regions that concentrate a majority of data points of a certain class. Although support vector machines are widely used for regression, outlier detection, and classification, this module will focus on the latter.Decision tree methods are a common baseline model for classification tasks due to their visual appeal and high interpretability. This module walks you through the theory behind decision trees and a few hands-on examples of building decision tree models for classification. You will realize the main pros and cons of these techniques. This background will be useful when you are presented with decision tree ensembles in the next module.Ensemble models are a very popular technique as they can assist your models be more resistant to outliers and have better chances at generalizing with future data. They also gained popularity after several ensembles helped people win prediction competitions. Recently, stochastic gradient boosting became a go-to candidate model for many data scientists.This model walks you through the theory behind ensemble models and popular tree-based ensembles.Some classification models are better suited than others to outliers, low occurrence of a class, or rare events. The most common methods to add robustness to a classifier are related to stratified sampling to re-balance the training data. This module will walk you through both stratified sampling methods and more novel approaches to model data sets with unbalanced classes. Superb ,detailed, well explained, lots of hands on training through labs and most of the major alogrithms are covered! Keep up the good work. You guys are helping the community a lot :DThe course content is very great in the coding area and it is very helping. but a shortage that is clear is the theory behind every algorithm, the handling of it wasn't that much perfect.The course is very well structured, and the explanations very clear. I would only suggest enhancing the peer-review community since it takes a long time to get a review sometimes.I would like to give especial thanks to the instructor (the one in the videos) for his great job. It would be nice to know who is is.When will I have access to the lectures and assignments?Access to lectures and assignments depends on your type of enrollment. If you take a course in audit mode, you will be able to see most course materials for free. To access graded assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience, during or after your audit. If you don't see the audit option: What will I get if I subscribe to this Certificate?When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Certificate, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.  If you only want to read and view the course content, you can audit the course for free.More questions? Visit the Learner Help Center.
