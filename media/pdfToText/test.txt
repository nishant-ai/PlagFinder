Learning 
There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial
 and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at rand
om until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the comput
er encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and proced
ures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of i
mplementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situat
ions. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce th
e past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is a
ble to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar ver
bs. 
 
Reasoning 
To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either deductive or inductive.
 An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in
 the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this acci
dent was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in t
he deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the tr
uth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common
 in science, where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—u
ntil the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematic
s and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. 
 
Start-Up (Korean: � � � � ; RR: Seutateueop) is a South Korean television series starring Bae Suzy, Nam Joo-hyu
k, Kim Seon-ho and Kang Han-na.[1] The series revolves around a woman who has dreams of becoming an entrepre
neur like Steve Jobs, and her love triangle between a man who is secretly her first love and another man who is prete
nding to be her first love.[2] It aired on tvN from October 17 to December 6, 2020, every Saturday and Sunday at 21
:00 (KST). It is available for streaming on Netflix.[3] 
 
There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. 
However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences relevant to the s
olution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. 
 
Strong AI, applied AI, and cognitive simulation 
Employing the methods outlined above, AI research attempts to reach one of three goals: strong AI, applied AI, or c
ognitive simulation. Strong AI aims to build machines that think. (The term strong AI was introduced for this catego
ry of research in 1980 by the philosopher John Searle of the University of California at Berkeley.) The ultimate ambi
tion of strong AI is to produce a machine whose overall intellectual ability is indistinguishable from that of a human 
being. As is described in the section Early milestones in AI, this goal generated great interest in the 1950s and ’60s, 
but such optimism has given way to an appreciation of the extreme difficulties involved. To date, progress has been 
meagre. Some critics doubt whether research will produce even a system with the overall intellectual ability of an an
t in the foreseeable future. Indeed, some researchers working in AI’s other two branches view strong AI as not worth
 pursuing. 
 
Applied AI, also known as advanced information processing, aims to produce commercially viable “smart” systems
—for example, “expert” medical diagnosis systems and stock-trading systems. Applied AI has enjoyed considerable 
success, as described in the section Expert systems. 
 
Set in South Korea's fictional Silicon Valley called Sandbox, Start-Up tells the story of people in the world of startup
 companies. 
 
Seo Dal-mi (Bae Suzy) is a bright and ambitious young woman who dreams of becoming Korea's Steve Jobs. Dal-mi
 doesn't have a fancy background but she's passionate about her work. She has bright energy and is a person of great 
vitality, having experience in a wide range of part-time jobs. 
 
Nam Do-san (Nam Joo-hyuk), is the founder of Samsan Tech. A ‘math genius’, or genius savant, as a young boy, Do
-san was once the pride of his family but became their shame now, as his business has been going down for the past t
wo years. He finds out that Dal-mi mistakenly remembers him as her first love, so he decides to work his way up in 
hopes of turning that misunderstanding into reality. 
 
In cognitive simulation, computers are used to test theories about how the human mind works—for example, theorie
s about how people recognize faces or recall memories. Cognitive simulation is already a powerful tool in both neur
oscience and cognitive psychology. 
 
artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly 
associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with 
the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or lear
n from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that co
mputers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical 
theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed 
and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks r
equiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of hum
an experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is 
found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognitio
n. 
 
  
How Does Artificial Intelligence Work? 
  
AI Approaches and Concepts 
Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World Wa
r II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?"  
 
Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and its subsequent Turing Test, established the fund
amental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.    
 
At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the en
deavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. 
 
The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singul
ar definition of the field is universally accepted.
